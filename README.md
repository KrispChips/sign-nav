# Sign reading + intersection demo (iPhone now, Meta glasses later)

Pipeline, all on the PC:

```
frames + IMU ──► undistort ──► Grounding DINO ──► tracker (keeps BEST sighting per sign)
                                                       │  when good enough, or when sign is lost
                                                       ▼
            speech ◄── describe() ◄── arrow → user frame ◄── Gemma 4 E4B ◄── perspective-rectified crop

undistorted frame ──► Depth Anything V2 (ONNX) ──► farness profile ──► opening detector ──► camera side → user side ──► speech
```

| File | Role | Changes for glasses? |
|---|---|---|
| `sources.py` | frames, camera undistortion, IMU | **Yes, only this** (new frame generator + calibration file) |
| `detector.py` | open-vocab sign detection | No |
| `rectify.py` | quad fit, homography warp, true aspect from intrinsics, frontality | No |
| `tracker.py` | tracking + best-sighting selection | Maybe tune thresholds |
| `direction.py` | bearing, heading, wall-sign arrow mapping | No |
| `vlm.py` | Gemma via Ollama, JSON output | No |
| `intersection.py` | depth model, farness profile, opening detector (from `geometric_intersection_detection.ipynb`) | No |
| `main.py` | the loop, TTS, debug logging | No |

## Setup (PC)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
ollama pull gemma4:e4b          # ollama must be running
```
Grounding DINO tiny and Depth Anything V2 small (int8 ONNX) download from Hugging Face on first run. A GPU helps a lot (CPU works, slowly).

## 1. Record test walks with the iPhone

- Settings > Camera > Formats > **Most Compatible** (H.264, so OpenCV can read it).
- Use the **0.5x ultra-wide** lens (closest to the glasses' field of view).
- Strap the phone to your head. Don't aim it at signs.
- Record IMU at the same time with any sensor-logging app, then convert to CSV with
  columns `t,yaw_deg` (or `t,gyro_z` in rad/s). Yaw must **increase when you turn right**;
  if not, pass `--gyro-sign -1`.
- To sync video and IMU, do a sharp head shake at the start. Find the time in each
  and pass the difference as `--imu-offset`.

## 2. Calibrate the ultra-wide (once)

Film a printed checkerboard, covering the frame edges and corners, at the same resolution you record at:
```bash
python calibrate.py --video board.mov --cols 9 --rows 6 --square 0.025 --out iphone_uw.npz
```
Without calibration the demo assumes `--hfov 100` with no distortion, which is fine for a first run
but makes bearings and rectification worse at the image edges.

## 3. Run

```bash
python main.py --source walk.mov --imu walk_imu.csv --calib iphone_uw.npz --show
```
Live, any stream OpenCV can open works, e.g. `--source rtsp://<phone-ip>:8554/live`, or the
webcam index if the iPhone shows up as a camera on your PC. Live IMU: send UDP JSON
`{"yaw_deg": 12.3}` to `--udp-imu 9001`.

## Debugging

Everything lands in `debug_out/`:
- `trackNNNN.jpg`: the exact crop sent to Gemma (check rectification here first)
- `reads.jsonl`: raw model output, parsed entries, quality, bearing, wall/facing decision, and what was spoken

The `--show` window draws tracks: orange = still collecting sightings, green = sent to the VLM.

- `intersections.jsonl`: per frame, raw and smoothed left/center/right farness, the 24-column
  profile, open/closed label, and for events the user-frame bearings and what was spoken
- `opening_NNNNN.Ns.jpg`: the frame at each opening event

Knobs: `--ready-q` (lower = read earlier but from worse views), `--box-thr` (detector
confidence), `--fps`. Wall vs facing thresholds are in `direction.mounting()`.

## Intersections

Openings on the left, right, or both are announced as e.g. *"Opening ahead on your left."*
Tune `--open-thr` / `--close-thr` (and the other `IntersectionDetector` settings) on your clips
the same way as in the notebook: the logged `ema` values are the notebook's smoothed L/C/R curves.
`--depth-long-side` trades depth quality for speed; `--no-intersections` turns it off.
Depth updates pause while the head is turned more than 25° from the walking direction,
since the image edges are then not the sides of the hallway.

## Moving to the glasses

Write a generator like `video_frames()` that yields `Frame(image, t, K, yaw_deg)` from the
glasses stream and the glasses IMU, recalibrate with `calibrate.py` on glasses footage,
and keep everything else. Hook `Announcer.say()` into your navigation stack's speech output.

## Known limits

- Heading = smoothed head yaw. If your nav stack has a better body heading, use it in `Heading`.
- Intersections: left/right/both openings only. No T vs four-way, no wall-ahead detection
  (relative depth always calls the farthest thing "far"). Open doors can look like openings.
- The head-turn pause only covers glances. A turn held longer than about a second becomes the
  new walking direction, so detection resumes.
- Up/down arrows on wall-mounted signs are ambiguous by convention; they're announced as such.
- Grounding DINO is slow per frame. Once it works, auto-label your recordings with it and
  train a small YOLO for the real-time detector.
